    At the top of the liri.js file, write the code you need to grab the data 
    from keys.js. Then store the keys in a variable.

    Make it so liri.js can take in one of the following commands:

    - my-tweets

    - spotify-this-song

    - movie-this

    - do-what-it-says


    
    node liri.js my-tweets 
    show last 20 tweets and when they were created

    node liri.js spotify-this-song 'song name'
    show song info:
        artist(s)
        the song's name
        a preview link of the song from Spotify
        the album that the song is from
        or default to ('The Sign' by Ace of Base)

    node liri.js movie-this 'movie name'
    output:
        title
        year
        imdb rating
        country where produced
        language
        plot
        actors
        rotten tomatoes rating
        rotten tomatoes url

    node liri.js do-what-it-says
        take text from random.txt and run the appropriate command

    bonus: output to a text file.
